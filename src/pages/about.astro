      My name is Frans Ekman, and I'm a web developer based in Stockholm,
      Sweden. I currently work at Handelsbanken where I specialize in front-end
      development. In my free time, I love working on my own passion projects
      that let me explore new ideas. I studied interaction design at Stockholm
      University but eventually found my way into programming and web
      development. Besides coding, I enjoy video games, music, tennis, and
      learning new things.
